			    		<li> When I was 11 years old in 1968 I was graduating from being a Brownie to a Girl Scout.  I vividly remember the school cafeteria at PS 114 in Belle Harbor.  All of the Brownies stood in a single file line, which stretched the length of the cafeteria.  Our parents, including Mother, were all in attendance.  When it was my turn to step up to the microphone to take the Girl Scout oath of allegiance, I asked a simple eleven-year-old question.  “Do I have to recite the oath in order to become a Girl Scout?”  The scout leader at the microphone answered a surprised at the question response, “yes.”  Little Bonnie Saltzman pondered that answer for less than a second.  “I am against the war in Vietnam.  I cannot recite the oath.  The oath stated, “I will do my duty to God and my country.”  That was it.  My somewhat embarrassed Mother, heard my conviction, as did the rest of the cafeteria filled with Mothers and their young daughters.  No one responded, no one was heard to make any type of support or rejection of my simple statement.  That was it.  I wasn’t going to trade in my Brownie uniform to become a Girl Scout with the rest if my classmates.  I didn’t believe what my country was doing in Vietnam was good for anyone.  It was a disaster that had been going on since I was 3 years old. By the time I was standing in front of that cafeteria of girls and their Moms, the war had been raging for eight long years.  During that time, I had spent every evening at our diner table listening to the news.  My Father’s ritual was to watch the evening news while we ate supper.  No one was allowed to speak during the news or they faced the wrath of Marty’s rage.  Having sat in silence, holding our breaths to stifle a belch, having no option but to watch current events in the news.  I began my foray into being an armchair conscientious objector.  It wasn’t until I faced the dilemma of having to say I supported whatever my country stood for, that I actually voiced my opinion on the Vietnam War. </li>
