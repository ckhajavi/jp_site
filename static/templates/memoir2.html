					    <li>There are three defining moments that pushed me to take control of what had become my fat, middle-aged, lumpy body.  I was a far cry from the hottie I once was.  
						The first time was in a dressing room of a department store with all of those horrible mirrors that reflect back every angle of your body. Then there were the unforgiving fluorescent lights that hummed in agreement with the saleswoman who said “That’s very slenderizing on you”.  At first I was in disbelief.  No one had ever said that to me before.  Oh my, she is talking to me! There it was, all these lumps and bumps of pink slime filler settled over my once envied figure.  It wasn’t me she was taking to I decided. She was talking to those arrogant fat cells ensconced en masse all over my hips, ass, and tummy and wherever else they felt comfortable.  “They are not me”, I told myself.  “The fat doesn’t define me or who I am”.  I am still I inside. I hadn’t been fat enough long enough to know how differently other people judge you when you are fat. </li>
						<li>The second defining moment came in 2011. I travelled to New York for a farewell party for my favorite NYU professor, Salvatore Tagliarino.  </li>
						<li>I had also planned during my quick trip to NY, to dutifully visit with my Mother.  March of 2011 turned out to be the last time I would see her. </li>
						<li>My Mother remarked to me during that brief visit, “Wow, look at your ass.  It’s huge.”  On top of that comment, she didn’t like my shaitel<sup>1</sup>  either.  She was always my harshest critic.  Nothing about me passed her muster without her having something critical or hurtful to say.  Never praises. I have been trying my whole life to be good enough and be worthy of her love. </li>
						<li>This affront gave me the final push and determination to really focus on my goal.  Lose fifty pounds. I was going to once again, set out prove to my mother that I am worthy to be loved no matter what. I needed a plan.</li>
						<li>My third and final wakeup call came from a Bat Kol<sup>2</sup>.  A Heavenly Voice! I was already in the process of trying to get control of my body weight when I was confronted by an obviously younger, slimmer and angrier version of myself. Here was this Jewish woman who, like me, was in her final preparations to usher in the holy Shabbat.  The sun soon would be setting over our Pico/ Robertson shtetl<sup>3</sup>. The streets and stores were filled with other Jews rushing to get their final Shabbat purchases before the kosher markets shuttered their stores until Sunday morning.  As Shabbat observant Jews, we can’t shop for twenty-five hours.  There is a lot more you can’t during those twenty-five hours but that is for another parshah <sup>4</sup>.   You see, we can never be sure if we have enough food, so we always have to have extra. G-D forbid we should not have enough food. </li>
						<li>So here is what happened one Friday afternoon in June.  I was driving my older model Toyota minivan into the entrance of the small strip mall parking lot on Pico and Glenville when another vehicle, also driven by an apparently Torah observant woman who was trying to exit.  However, she was attempting to leave through the entrance.  The exit is on the opposite side of the lot. It was clear by the way she was glaring and honking her horn at me that she didn’t like that I was preventing her from exiting.  I was not backing up.  I couldn’t even if I wanted to.  So what she was expecting me to do I am not sure.  I am sure about this however, for Los Angeles standards, I was clearly an inferior human being to her by the mere fact I was in a 2002 Toyota Minivan.  Her car was brand new, still with the paper dealer tags, which was proof of her superiority and the reason why it is, that I should acquiesce to her demands.  Couldn’t I see her black shiny Suburban? I assumed it is also used to haul around her holy Jewish children to their religious day schools.  Couldn’t I see that I needed to move out of her way?  She was in a hurry.  No I couldn’t.  I’m all for showing kavod<sup>5</sup> for someone I truly respect. This woman did not fall into that category.  Besides, I was clearly on the right side of the law. So there we were, my inferior bumper mere inches away from her superior bumper.  I just sat there, waiting and watching to see what she would do.  After a few minutes, I decided to get out and speak to her.  We were obviously at an impasse and the Shabbat Queen was coming.  Long story short, we exchanged a few un-pleasantries and as I was getting back into my car she yelled, for no apparent reason other than to be mean, or she was momentarily possessed by a Malach<sup>6</sup>, something regarding my other fatal flaw which confirmed me to be sub-human human. I had an obviously huge ass, a fat face, no neck, and a double chin with a shaitel on top. “You are just a big fat bitch.” She screamed at me in anger. “You’re still fat from a kid that you had, what, twenty years ago?”  Then she reversed her Chevy Suburban, a three ton hunk of steel and combustible fuel, just enough to allow me and my, lowlier than thou, vehicle squeeze past her. The Chevy Suburban roared powerfully under the pedal of her angry foot.  Was she just a food hording, Shabbat preparing, don’t you know the world was made just for me?” kind of Jewish woman?  Or is she is a daughter of Israel with the voice of an angel?</li>
						</li>Despite the fact that by all appearances, this holy Jewish woman ought to have been behaving in accordance with our shared Jewish beliefs, she wasn’t.  It must be a message from above.  “Hey Fatty!”</li>
						<li>Her words stung and rung of complete, in your face, the kind I like to dish out, truth. 
						First of all, she was correct.  I was fatter than I was after my son was born. Ouch. I still weighed in at a hefty one-hundred-and-sixty pounds. Double ouch. I weighed more than my Husband! I haven’t even been married twenty years.  My son was only thirteen years old. But, I got the point.</li>  
						<li>I looked older because I was fat. That was the painful truth. I had somehow shrunk from my previous stature of five-foot-five inches to five-foot-four inches and increased my dress size from a size four to a size fourteen in almost as many years. After twenty months of breastfeeding, I spent four years injecting sub-cutaneous hormones into my belly, thigh and rear.  All of our attempts to bring a sibling into the world were now evident and happily ensconced in blobs of fat all over my well endowed, round hips, thighs, and body. It was very happy there and had no intention of going anywhere. Fat blobs had moved into spaces I never imagined it could. Like on my lovely long neck and exposed clavicles I once had. There are now two potato Pierogi<sup>7</sup> firmly ensconced over the lower portion of my ribcage on either side. I had morphed into a fatty.
						I should have been wearing a shirt that day with the words “I did Invitro for four years and all I got was FAT.  No BABY.  Just FAT!” emblazed across my chest. </li>
						<li>What is the secret to my successful weight loss and my continued success in keeping it off?  It’s not anything we all don’t already know; diet and exercise.  What I did was not really a “diet”.  It’s more of a program for weight loss based on a physiological perspective of how your body functions.  It is a lifelong, easy to maintain, scientifically based program.</li>
						<li>I have a young friend who had very quickly lost her “pregnancy” fat a year after her fifth child. She looked amazing for a Mother of five. I asked her how she did it.  “I went to Dr. Mazouz” she exclaimed as if I must have just fallen off a turntable for 45LP’s. 
						Weight Watchers® was not working.  I couldn’t listen to woman talk about how much Pirate Booty® they can eat, or counting points or weighing anything.  After a year, I had only succeeded in losing a few pounds.  </li>						
						<li>September 2012 I began my metabolic syndrome program with Doctor Mazouz.  He has a program that is easy to follow. There is nothing to weigh or measure.  The biggest problem is that I that have the hardest time wrapping my head around swallowing these huge pills he prescribes to boost your metabolism. They are all natural, herbal supplements. At the time, I was supposed to be taking like ten different pills all throughout the day.  </li>
						<li>I hate swallowing pills.  I have an unusually small trachea.  I’m kinda built small all around. The idea of gaging down some pills to lose this fat may seem appealing, easy and almost cheating to some, for me it is torture.</li>
						<li>So many people have said to me, “so what’s the big deal, you swallow a few pills and you lose the weight.  Sounds easy.”  Well, no, that isn’t all you have to do.  It’s more than metabolic boosting herbs.  It’s what you eat, when you eat, when you don’t eat, exercise and the pills.  
						I have no problem following all of the rest of the rules for the program.  My biggest challenge is those damn horse pills. </li> 
						<li>I spent the first year avoiding taking them as much as possible.  Every time I would walk into the reception area of his office I would proclaim for anyone who was there to listen, “I’m still fat!” I would say with a big smile and a lilting tone in my voice.</li>
						<li>Every time I would get on the magic scale that tells all of your secrets, I knew he would know.  You can’t lie to Dr. Mazouz and say you have been exercising when you really haven’t.  Mr. Magic Scale always knows your metabolic rate.  Mr. Scale knows how much weight you have gained or lost. Not just how much but what you lost or gained. Is it water weight, muscle or just more fat? Mr. Tanita Magic Scale gives it all in full detail. The Tanita Body Composition Analyzer® works like this; the nurse punches in your body type, gender, age and height.  You stand on the scale in your bare feet in nothing more than a paper gown and hold on to these handles connected by wires to Mr. Tanita, the techno savvy scale.  In just a few minutes it spits out a full report on your weight, BMI, BMR, your percentage of fat, your fat mass, your FFM and your TNT.  I have no idea what some of those measurements are.  What I can tell you though, Dr. Mazouz knows. And Mr. Tanita tells him in scintillating detail whether or not your body is responding to the program or if you are even how much you are participating in the program.</li>
						<li>At about a year into this metabolic weight loss program, Doctor Mazouz very sweetly said, “why don’t you try taking the pills everyday for one month?  Let’s see what happens. I gave it a try.  For one month I swallowed Garcinia Cambogia, white bean amylase and a myriad of other supplements religiously.  Low and behold when I went back to stand on Mr. Tanita a month later and hold his handles he declared I had lost about 12 pounds of fat.  Okay, gagging not withstanding, the supplements worked.  I committed to taking them as well as continuing following the program and the result is what you see now.  I weigh between 122 and 125, I wear a size six dress, my ass is considerably smaller and the Pilates workouts I do four times a week has toned my body to the point where I look pretty hot for my age.  I’m so grateful to have evicted the fat blobs that were squatting all over my body without my permission.  The invaders on my clavicles are still there, concealing my long slender neck.  The Pierogi shaped blobs of fat on my ribs still there too.  It’s a daily choice.</li>
						<li>It’d up to you to decide if you want a healthy fit body.</li>
